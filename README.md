# Python-GUI-examples
A hodgepodge collection of bare-bones examples for performing common GUI-related tasks in python. Emphasis on linear data plotting, image processing, and frequency analysis. Examples are often accompanied by posts on www.SWHarden.com

## Plotting Data in PyQt4
* [scrolling live data with MatplotlibWidget] (2016-07-30_qt_matplotlib_sine_scroll) - pretty graphs, but slow
* [scrolling live data with PlotWidget] (2016-07-31_qt_PyQtGraph_sine_scroll) - extremely high speed graphing

## Realtime Audio Analysis
* [live PCM and FFT plotting with QtGraph] (https://github.com/swharden/Python-GUI-examples/tree/master/2016-07-37_qt_audio_monitor)
